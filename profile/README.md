Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is the GitHub Organisation for the [Royal Statistical Society (RSS)](https://rss.org.uk/) Charity Datathon 2024.

This is an event in collaboration with the
[RSS Statisticians for Society (S4S) initiative](https://rss.org.uk/membership/volunteering-and-promoting/statisticians-for-society-initiative/).
Statisticians for Society is a _pro bono_ scheme that connects professional statisticians and charitable organisations. Originally launched as a pilot project in 2017, the scheme has become an effective way for organisations to receive support from statistical experts at no cost. Our volunteer statisticians have been linked with over 60 organisations, helping them fulfil their charitable aims and objectives.

The datathon will be the first time we combine the work of S4S with a datathon format.
Join us on this journey of innovation, exploration, and problem-solving as we harness the power and insight of data to benefit charities and those they help.

### What is a datathon?
Similar to hackathons, a datathon is an event where participants gather to solve practical problems through the application of data science tools and techniques, by working together in teams to generate insights and potential solutions.
These events create a special sense of purpose to achieve something greater collectively in a relatively short space of timethat often emerge when working intensely in a time-bound setting.
Participants will present their work and findings at the end.
If youâ€™re passionate about tackling interesting challenges met by UK charities, a datathon is for you.

### How is the datathon organized?
There are a few key components:

* Available problems and data: Representative from charities will be involved throughout. They will be the problem customdians and help to define and steer the projects.
* A positive environment for participants to learn new data skills and produce impactful results
* A chance for participants to make professional connections, and for everyone to have fun :tada:!

### Challenges
The final, detailed list of problems to tackle at the datathon have not been finalised. This is because the pool of projects are continually being braught to the S4S team from different charities and being addressed by the group of S4S vounteers in a one-to-one format. Closer to the time of the event the final list of project and their details will be released to registered attendees to choose from.

Some past project tackled by the S4S volunteers and potentially appropriate for the datathon include the following:

* [Audience research for Ensemble Cymru](https://rss.org.uk/membership/volunteering-and-promoting/statisticians-for-society-initiative/case-studies/ensemble-cymru/): Devised a classification of classical audience attendees. Used these classifications to match with the mosaic classes and hence choose the postcode sectors likely to provide concert attendees.
* [National Survivor User Network (NSUN) activity analysis](https://rss.org.uk/membership/volunteering-and-promoting/statisticians-for-society-initiative/case-studies/national-survivor-user-network/) Past membersâ€™ surveys were analysed for representativeness of the general membership. Trends in membership demographics and interests were tracked over 10 years and presented graphically.

### Who can particpate?
Just like for the current S4S project work, participants of the datathon must be fellows of the RSS.
Beyond that, teams of 3-5 researchers, students, professionals from academia, government agencies, private sector companies or enthusiasts with a background in data science, statistics, economics, and social sciences are all welcome to apply!
Teams will be defined prior to the day of the event so that teams can start as soon as possible. They will be selected according to the skills specified in the application process and one person will be the team leader.

### When is it?
The datathon will be organized Spring 2024 in London. The final date has yet to be confirmed.
The event will be held over the course of one days. This will hopefully sustain engagement and still be long enough to meet our objectives. Future events may be longer, over several days.
We will start in the morning with problem presentations and team forming and then begin exploring the data.
Coffee will be available throughout the day and lunch will be provided.

### Where is it held?
This will be a mix of in-person and virtual collaborations.
The in-person event will take place at RSS headquarters, Errol Street, London.
Remote participation will use Zoom and GitHub.

### After the event
Teams and charities will continue to be in contact to ensure that all the needs of the project are fully met.
